The background of the projectï¼š

Many studies have shown that house prices in different regions are highly correlated with the standard of living and poverty levels of the population[1]. This phenomenon has been widely studied globally, especially in large cities with high housing costs. Housing costs account for a significant portion of total household expenditures, especially in large cities and economically developed regions. High house prices and rents lead to a reduction in the disposable income of low-income households, thereby increasing the risk of these households falling into poverty[2]. Housing policies play a key role in alleviating or exacerbating poverty. For example, studies in Australia and the United Kingdom have shown that social security and housing subsidies have been effective in reducing the pressure of housing costs on low-income households, but a large number of households still fall into "housing cost-induced poverty" as a result of high house prices[3].
This project examines the correlation between regional poverty levels and housing prices, which will not only help to understand the mechanism of the impact of housing costs on poverty and provide a basis for the formulation of effective housing and social security policies, but will also provide a reference for regional development and urban planning, and promote balanced regional economic development.
